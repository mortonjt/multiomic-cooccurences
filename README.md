# multiomic-cooccurences

This repository holds the analysis scripts and cystic fibrosis datasets to showcase the utility of applying neural networks to learn multi-omics cooccurences.

# Run scripts
The scripts within the `scripts` folder contains scripts used to run `rhapsody mmvec` for co-occurrrence analysis and `songbird multinomial` for differential abundance.
Case study specific visualizations and preprocessing can be found within the `ipynb` notebooks and in the `results`.

The command used to generate the cystic fibrosis co-occurences is found under the scripts folder. This was a result of multiple rounds of cross validation with parameters with learning rates (1e-5, 1e-6, 1e-7), input priors (0.1, 1, 10),  output priors (0.1, 1, 10) and a rank of 3.

When running these commands, it will take a substantial amount of compute time, so be sure to allocate multiple days to run.
It is also recommended to run Tensorboard in parallel in order to monitor the convergence of the algorithm.

The notebooks for producing the figures in the manuscript.  They are given as follows
 - ipynb/Figure2-simulation.ipynb                  : Illustration of the CF biofilm simulation
 - ipynb/Figure2_biofilm.ipynb                     : CF biofilm simulation with addition sampling noise
 - ipynb/Figure2-benchmarks.ipynb                  : Benchmark figures based on CF biofilm simulation
 - ipynb/Figure3-biocrust.ipynb                    : Biocrust case study
 - ipynb/Figure4-cystic-fibrosis.ipynb             : Cystic Fibrosis case study
 - ipynb/Figure5-high-fat-diet.ipynb               : High fat diet case study
 - ipynb/Figure5-inflammatory-bowel-disease.ipynb  : IBD multiomics case study
 - ipynb/FigureS2-simulation.ipynb                 : Scaling simulation / benchmark

There are also auxiliary notebooks on how to extract parameters from a model checkpoint.
This is useful for real time diagnostics and debugging.
